# VHDL Code for FPGAs

This is a collection of code from CDA 4240C: Design of Digital Systems.

 - This code runs on the [Nexys A7-100T](https://www.digikey.com/en/product-highlight/d/digilent/nexys-a7-100t-artix-7-series-fpga-evaluation-board) FPGA Evaluation Board.

 - My Projects were simulated and synthesized using [Xilinx Vivado 2022.2](https://www.xilinx.com/support/download.html)
